## PBL 1 Automatic steering (Fuzzy Logic)
This project demonstrates a basic steering mechanism using Fuzzy Logic.

Warranty not included.

## PBL 2 Backtracking & Depth first search
Here, depth first search is used to complete the [Knight's Tour Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour) (Wikipedia)

It also implements a method of searching the smallest tree first (see "Warnsdorff's Rule"), thus drastically improving the average case computing time.

## PBL 3 Game theory
A basic algorithm to play Nim and always win. Implements basic game theory (minimise opponent's advantage, expect best move from opponent).

This algorithm does not implement any alpha-beta pruning.

*note, this is probably the messiest project file.*

## PBL 4 Genetic Algorithms
Implement Genetic Algorithms to find approximate solutions to the [Travelling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) (Wikipedia)
